this is an application i'm building to learn MEAN stack and git.

users can create job listings, anyone can fund them, creators choose which of the replies get the funds. everything uses bitcoin testnet.

development is probably abandoned because the blockexplorer api which used to work well is now giving nondeterministic results. transactions will most likely fail now. and i don't have a raspberry pi to run a full node on, and dont want to bother another api with my nonessential requests
